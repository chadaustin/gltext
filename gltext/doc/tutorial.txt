This is a very simple introduction to the easy to use GLText API.

1.
Make sure you include the gltext header.

   #include <gltext.h>

2.
First you'll need to open a font. The font describes how each character
looks to the renderer. You need to specify:
   - the name of the file that contains the font definition
   - the style of font you want to create
   - the point size of the font you want
If the creation fails, CreateFont will return NULL.

   gltext::Font* myFont = gltext::CreateFont("arial.ttf", gltext::PLAIN, 24);

3.
Create a renderer for the font. The renderer is responsible for making the
OpenGL calls necessary to draw the text you want on the screen. You must tell
GLText what type of renderer you want. If the creation fails, CreateRenderer
will return NULL.

  gltext::Renderer* myRenderer = gltext::CreateRenderer(gltext::PIXMAP);

4.
Tell the renderer which font you want to use when it draws your text to the
screen.

   myRenderer->setFont(myFont);

5.
Set up the OpenGL MODELVIEW matrix to place the font on the screen and ask the
renderer to show off its tough stuff. Note that the renderer will use the
current OpenGL color to draw the text.

   glMatrixMode(GL_MODELVIEW);
   glTranslatef(100, 100, 100);
   glColor4f(1, 1, 1, 0.5f);
   myRenderer->render("hello world");

6.
When you're done, make sure you delete your fonts and renderers.

That's it! Look in gltext.h for descriptions of the remaining functions.
